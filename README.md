## About

This is a collection of both miscellaneous development experiments and images I rely on for various things.

## Usage

There are a variaty of images here and how to use them will vary. The easy way is to use tool such as `dive` to inspect the images and see what they contain. You can also use `docker run` to run the images and see what they do.

Here an example:
```bash
dive ghcr.io/socheatsok78/github-cli:latest
```
