## About

This is a collection of both miscellaneous development experiments and images I rely on for various things.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that some of these images are for private use only and will not be published to the public. If you are interested in any of these images, please fork the repository and build them yourself.

## Usage

There are a variaty of images here and how to use them will vary. The easy way is to use tool such as `dive` to inspect the images and see what they contain. You can also use `docker run` to run the images and see what they do.

Here an example:
```bash
dive ghcr.io/socheatsok78/github-cli:latest
```
