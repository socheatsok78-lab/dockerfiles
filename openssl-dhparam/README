## Diffie-Hellman (DH) parameters
Diffieâ€“Hellman (DH) key exchange[nb 1] is a mathematical method of securely generating a symmetric cryptographic key over a public channel and was one of the first protocols as conceived by Ralph Merkle and named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman.

## Usage

How to use the generated Diffie-Hellman parameters in your Nginx configuration, following the example below:

```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/socheatsok78/openssl-dhparam:latest AS dhparam
FROM nginx:stable
COPY --from=dhparam --link /dhparam.pem /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem
```

```nginx
# nginx.conf
http {
    # ...
    # Diffie-Hellman parameter for DHE ciphersuites
    ssl_dhparam            /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem;
    # ...
}
```
